# Variant of solving "Longest Common Substring Problem"

[The longest common substring problem](http://www.softpanorama.org/Algorithms/lcs.shtml) is to find the longest string (or strings) that is a substring (or are substrings) 
of two or more strings. It should not be confused with the longest common subsequence problem. (For an explanation of 
the difference between a substring and a subsequence, see Substring vs. subsequence).

## Simplification:
Constructs longest string as a substring of input string consisting of no more than two different characters.
